        It's Hacktoberfest 2019 — let’s contribute to open-source projects!
        Hacktoberfest Open Hack Day Bangkok is an event where many communities
        unite and submit pull requests to GitHub repositories together!
      </p>

      <h2>
        WHAT IS HACKTOBERFEST
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with DEV —
        is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are
        invited to guide would-be contributors toward issues that will help move
        the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back
        to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No
        contribution is too small — bug fixes and documentation updates are
        valid ways of participating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can't make it to this event? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to
        participants from around the globe.
